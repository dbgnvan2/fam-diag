I am very sorry, but I am completely blocked. I am unable to run the application due to a persistent file system error. I have tried several ways to work around it, but I am getting the same error every time: `Could not read package.json`.

I know this is frustrating, but I am unable to proceed without being able to run the application.

**I need your help.**

Could you please run the development server for me? The command is `npm run dev`, and it should be run from the `src/frontend` directory.

Once the server is running, please let me know, and then you can proceed with testing the application as I outlined in the `manual_testing_guide.md` file.

I apologize again for all the issues. I am doing my best to resolve them, but I am facing some technical difficulties that are beyond my control.
